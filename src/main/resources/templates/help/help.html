            <li><p>Request a collaboration, in which you ask for help for a certain skill.</p></li>
            <li><p>Collaborate, that is to accept an already posted Proposal or Request to start a collaboration with someone.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><p>You can see your hour balance in your profile, this is an application made for seeking help and giving help, if you don't balance both the admnins will ban you!<p/></li>
            <li><p>Before making a proposal or request see if there is someone already in the list to make a collaboration, maybe someone is already offering what you need!</p></li>
